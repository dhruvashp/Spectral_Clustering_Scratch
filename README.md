# Spectral_Clustering_Scratch

The above set of codes performs Spectral Clustering from scratch (including the k means clustering needed for Spectral Clustering)

MATLAB does provide a library to perform k means directly, so even that was used and the results compared with my code from scratch

The coding was done for course EE546 under Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi at USC in Fall 2020. The code was submitted in the repository around Spring 2021, to 'publicize' the work done for the course
