Final Files

Final files loops over all gamma and k values

In the final files the MATLAB inbuilt function was used

The restart parameter was set to 1, primarily due to large run times. With just a single restart, both files still took about 5-6 hours to run. Thus, adding more restarts would have taken extremely long time.


The results for this final code are summarized in two .csv files :

Error_Matrix_aca2 
Error_Matrix_aca5

Both files contain % misclassification errors with rows corresponding to values of gamma and columns corresponding to values of k (sequentially, obviously)
